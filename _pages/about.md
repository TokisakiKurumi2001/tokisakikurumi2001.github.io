Hi there, I'm Kh√¥i. I'm currenly a AI Resident at [VinAI Research Residency Program](https://www.vinai.io/vinai-ai-residency/). My mentor is [Assistant Professor Luu Anh Tuan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=d6ixOGYAAAAJ).

My research aims to develop effective and efficient methods for advancing and democratizing artificial intelligence in the era of large language models (LLMs). Specific areas of focus include:

- **Data sampling**: effectively pre-determining the needed data resources for adapting the LLMs to new skills.
- **Low-resource adaptation**: injecting data-scarced knowledge into LLMs, including knowledge from low-resource languages.
- **Parameter-efficient transfer learning**: efficiently transferring knowledge across tasks, languages, and modalities.
- **Model distillation**: scaling down model without minimal trade-offs.
